Below steps are for Windows machine to run React app in Production mode-

1. Got to root folder of your app
2. Execute below command to build the app
	 npm run build
3. Execute below command to start the server in local
	serve -s build
4. You may see below error-
	serve : The term 'serve' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
   It is because of local security windows policy
5. We can override this by running powershell in Administrator mode
6. Then execute below command in Powershell
	Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
	Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
7. Now repeat (3) & it will show that server is running on local at - http://localhost:3000
8. Can use Ctrl+c to stop the server
9. Once done with local running then remove the exceution policy update in (6) by
	Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Undefined -Scope LocalMachine

To run in Development mode then just execute below command on application root
	npm start

How to know if you are running local server or production server?
1. Install React Developer Tools for Chrome
2. Pin it in tool bar of chrome
3. If the server is running in local then React Developer Tools icon will be in Red else it will be Blue
